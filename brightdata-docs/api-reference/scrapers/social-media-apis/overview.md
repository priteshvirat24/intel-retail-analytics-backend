## How the endpoints are organized

Each Social Media Scraper API endpoint is dedicated to a single data type and a single input method. Endpoint names follow the pattern `{platform}-{object}-{action}-by-{input}`, for example `instagram-posts-collect-by-url` or `reddit-posts-discover-by-keyword`.

Two action types cover every endpoint:

* **Collect by URL**: you pass one or more canonical URLs and receive the structured record for each target (profile, post, video, job, listing). Use this when you already know what you want.
* **Discover by keyword, username, category or hashtag**: you pass a query and the endpoint returns the matching set of URLs and records. Use this when you need to find items before collecting them.

You can chain the two. Run a `discover` endpoint first to build a URL list, then feed that list into the matching `collect-by-url` endpoint on the same platform.

## Endpoint coverage by platform

## Data types each platform exposes

The endpoints map to three data types that are interconnected, so the output of one can be the input to another:

* **Profiles**: user, page, channel or company data, with metrics such as followers, subscribers and post counts.
* **Posts**: individual posts, reels, videos, jobs or listings, with engagement metrics such as likes, views, comments and hashtags.
* **Comments**: replies and reactions attached to a specific post or video.

### Example: end-to-end YouTube collection

1. Call `youtube-channels-discover-by-keyword` with a search term to find channels.
2. Pass the channel URLs to `youtube-channels-collect-by-url` for channel metadata.
3. Pass the same channel URLs to `youtube-videos-collect-by-url` to fetch videos.
4. Pass the resulting video URLs to `youtube-comments-collect-by-url` to fetch comments.

The same chain pattern applies to every other supported platform.
