        "comment": "Great location. Double room with city view was very spacious. Nice gym. Helpful staff all throughout the hotel. Nice random free wine hour one evening. It’s a very large hotel.\n\nMy only two complaints are:\n\nWaiting for the elevator can be very annoying in the mornings and evenings. We ended up using the alternative elevator one morning because the normal ones came by already packed.\n\nThe hot water situation. In order for us to get hot water, we had to run the faucet for 5-7 mins. This was something I had never encountered in any hotel I’ve ever stayed at and was a disappointment considering this hotel is a 4-star hotel. I had to repeat this for each person in the room who planned to shower. It was also an inconvenience during a colder week to not have hot water immediately available.",
        "review_reply": "Dear Rose,\nThank you for staying with us and for sharing these thoughtful details. Hearing that the city view room felt spacious, the gym supported your routine, our team was genuinely helpful, and the surprise wine hour added a nice touch means a great deal. However, we regret the elevator congestion during peak times and the delay before hot water reached the tap. We'll be sure to share your comments with maintenance to improve speed and consistency. Your stay should feel seamless from elevator timing to a comfortable shower, and we hope to welcome you back for a seamless experience down the line.\n\nSincerely,\n\nNew York Hilton Midtown Team\n\nNYCNH_FO@hilton.com",

        "comment": "We visit NYC at least once a year. The Hilton Midtown is well located. Hotel lobby has no sitting area for guest to rest. We waited 30 mins to check in, November 21st Friday, so prepared long waiting time. Booked a room with two beds, end up given one king and a pull out couch, the hotel is totally sold out. The front desk lady was not very friendly. She was exhausted and not  very patient. I am in hospitality business, it’s understandable but not acceptable. It didn’t bother me . Management team should either train your employees better or schedule more employees to work. The hotel room is spacious for NYC, but the pull out couch is stained. I will have to call at late night to request sheets to cover it. Hotel Gym is big and well equipped. I also just read they charge $5 per luggage to store your luggage after check out which I will need this service when we check out on Monday. I travel everywhere in the world. First time see a nice hotel charging luggage storage.  Hilton should know you are not Handling hostels guests. Your guests need only couple of  hours to be hands free before catching their flight.",
        "review_reply": "Dear Megan,\nThank you for sharing your comments about your recent stay. It is disappointing to hear about the long check-in wait, the room type not matching your reservation, and the condition of the sofa bed. The experience at the front desk should feel patient and professional, and it is regrettable that this interaction felt otherwise. Your points regarding service are important and will be reviewed internally. It is good to know that the room size and gym were positive aspects, and we hope to welcome you back for a visit that feels far more comfortable and well-supported.\n\nSincerely,\n\nNew York Hilton Midtown Team\n\nNYCNH_FO@hilton.com",

Service was very responsive, from checking bags on arrival to room requests.  Clean rooms although old, but no complaints.  Elevators are going through an upgrade process so some delays there, but just had to give yourself an extra 2-5 minutes incase they were delayed or crowded.\nI would definitely stay here again.",

It was very dated, screws missing out of the door handle, semi-clean, the bath tub wouldn’t drain-when I went to adjust the stopper it came out and the bath tub itself was pealing, the hotel staff were all less than pleasant!\n\nAs many others have mentioned the elevator stops a nightmare!",

It is 2025 and people need multiple sockets to charge phones, tablets, watches etc.||Staff were underwhelming. Our flight home was cancelled and we had to find accommodation for another night. I understand they couldn’t accept us as they were fully booked. I would have appreciated some sort of effort to see if other Hilton hotels available but no, just a shrug of the shoulders pretty much and left to sort ourselves out. I understand that it is probably over there pay grade. However, a phone call or some sort of contact with other Hilton hotels would have been put our anxiety at ease. I am disappointed because i expect staff from the Hilton brand would excel at customer service, but they didn’t. They would’ve earned a decent tip from it. ||Only 2 things impressed me. The coffee machine in our room and the cleaning staff. They always did a superb job."

We had to separate as a group to put one person into an elevator every time it showed up and actually had room. While in the jam packed elevator you would stop at every single floor, only for most of them to not even have anyone getting off there or waiting. We used to love this hotel, now we’ll be looking for a different midtown stay.",

We walked about 5 miles a day to see what we wanted and to go where we wanted.  Subway was easy to use.  The elevators are nice, but they do need more.  Construction on one, but there is almost always a line to go up and getting down is awful.  Give yourself plenty of time and the higher the room, the easier to get “on”.  Oftentimes people had been waiting multiple stops for the elevator to get down to the lobby, if on lower floors, but it would be full.  That was the only pitfall, but could be a significant one if you are in a hurry.",
