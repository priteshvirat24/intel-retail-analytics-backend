        "comment": "Awesome location, rooms were clean and comfortable.  Bar drinks are just ok, food is meh.  But I didn’t go to NYC to eat/drinkk in my hotel.  Its location is perfect.  We walked about 5 miles a day to see what we wanted and to go where we wanted.  Subway was easy to use.  The elevators are nice, but they do need more.  Construction on one, but there is almost always a line to go up and getting down is awful.  Give yourself plenty of time and the higher the room, the easier to get “on”.  Oftentimes people had been waiting multiple stops for the elevator to get down to the lobby, if on lower floors, but it would be full.  That was the only pitfall, but could be a significant one if you are in a hurry.",

We are glad to hear you enjoyed the clean and comfortable rooms, as well as our convenient location, which made it easy to explore the city on foot and by subway.

        "comment": "Awesome location in the city, but outdated rooms, zero amenities, and the elevator situation was an absolute nightmare. We had to tack on at least 10+ minutes to account for the elevator ride alone, sometimes having to ride the elevator up to other floors just to catch it back down. Rooms were insanely hot at night with no way to bring down the temperature. Terrible experience, unfortunately. I expected more from a Hilton in such a prime location",

        "comment": "The difference in reviews on this hotel are just wild. I stayed on the 30th floor and found my room to be great. It was larger than what I typically expect from a hotel room in NYC and was so happy to see a couch!  Everything was clean, with exception of some rust stains around the shower drain.\nNo, the hotel rooms do not have coffee makers, however there's a coffee shop located in the lobby that was open at 5:30am.\nCheck in was a breeze, I checked in online and then visited the front desk to pick up a physical card. Service was fast and easy.\nThe hotel itself is in an awesome location!\n\nEdit to add: my most recent stay is wildly different.\nMy room on 32nd floor really needs refurbishment. The elevators have been absolutely horrible. Only 1 in my floor bank worked and on day 2 that even stopped, I ended up having to take the service elevator down.",

Staff were friendly and helpful, got us checked in very quickly despite our early arrival time.  The room was a good size by NYC standards and although a little older, it was clean and comfortable.  Awesome large windows with a great view.  Enjoyed hanging out in the Executive Lounge for coffee and a bit of peace and quiet!",

The rooms are very nice too.\n\nI love that you are an 8 min walk to so many things like Broadway theaters and Central Park too.  You can walk to so many places, take a rest in the executive lounge, and go out some more.\n\nMy family highly recommends this New York property."

The vibe is good and the rooms are nice. Special shout out to Willie who was working at the Bridges Bar in the lobby. Willie you are the reason I am writing this review. You are the most friendly and down to Earth guy I have met. You make Midtown Hilton awesome, keep it up! Willie is a solid 100/10.",

        "comment": "Great location, clean, staff friendly, executive club staff AWESOME.  THE Herb'N'Kitchen has no place being in any Hilton property though.  Food is good sometimes but usually just Okay.  Most of the staff there is very abrupt.  Every where else in the hotel is great..... Except... We were there over Christmas & even with the fan \"on\" constantly & the windows open..... It was very hot in our room. Housekeeping, security, concierge were all fantastic though!",

        "comment": "I am a Hilton diamond member and was quite excited to see what it would give me in New York. But I was dissatisfied with the \"perks\" we had reserved a standard king room knowing we would be upgraded. But that was a total failure, they upgraded us to a premium king room with an accessible bathroom. Which wasn't the issue. The issue was the room was damp and could smell the mold. So we called down to get switched into another room but they had sold our original room and down graded us to a double room...\n\nThe double room was clean but very outdated, the wall paper was curling and the fridge wasn't working.\n\nThe cleaning lady gets 5 stars though she was awesome, she went above and beyond for us.\n\nThe breakfast lobby was just a typical continental breakfast no warm foods. Nothing like any other hilton I had stayed at.\n\nI am just not sure how the hotel has a 4 star rating. It's an easy 3 star in my mind had they made the diamond experience better and put us in a king room of some kind.",
