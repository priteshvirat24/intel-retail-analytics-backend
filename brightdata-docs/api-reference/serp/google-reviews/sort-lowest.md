The rooms were adequate. The bathroom was disgusting and had discolored water forcing us to brush our teeth with bottled water. The wait for the elevators was ridiculous and we ended up using the service elevators and that area was absolutely disgusting and did not feel safe.",

What you have described regarding our accommodations, amenities, and the comfort and convenience we aim to consistently provide our guests is not typical for us. Rest assured, your insights will be promptly addressed for review and correction. We hope to welcome you back in the future to change your lasting impressions. \n\nSincerely,\n\nNew York Hilton Midtown Team\n\nNYCNH_FO@hilton.com",

It was very dated, screws missing out of the door handle, semi-clean, the bath tub wouldn’t drain-when I went to adjust the stopper it came out and the bath tub itself was pealing, the hotel staff were all less than pleasant!\n\nAs many others have mentioned the elevator stops a nightmare!",

We had to separate as a group to put one person into an elevator every time it showed up and actually had room. While in the jam packed elevator you would stop at every single floor, only for most of them to not even have anyone getting off there or waiting. We used to love this hotel, now we’ll be looking for a different midtown stay.",

        "comment": "Unfortunately, this stay was a major disappointment. We were asked to pay $100 for early check-in despite being Hilton members. The hotel was extremely overcrowded, the lobby was chaotic, and the elevator wait times were outrageous—often 10–20 minutes—forcing us to take the stairs from the 7th floor.\n\nLate checkout was denied unless we paid extra, bag storage took over 45 minutes and cost $5 per bag, and there weren’t even complimentary bottles of water in the room. Overall, the experience felt focused on squeezing money out of guests rather than providing hospitality. Very disappointing, and we will never stay at this hotel again.",
        "review_reply": "Dear Elizabeth,\nThank you for being a Hilton Honors member and for taking the time to share such a detailed account of your stay. We’re genuinely sorry to hear of the issues you encountered. Long elevator wait times and missing in-room amenities are never the impression we want any of our guests to have.  Your feedback will be reviewed with the team as we continue to focus on improving comfort, clarity, and support for all our guests. We appreciate you outlining your experience so thoughtfully and hope you will consider giving us another chance to improve your lasting impression.\n\nSincerely,\n\nNew York Hilton Midtown Team\n\nNYCNH_FO@hilton.com",

Service was dismissive in all areas. Starting with the front desk. They have convinced me to cancel my Hilton card and open a Marriott car, even as a Diamond member. Awful experience.",
