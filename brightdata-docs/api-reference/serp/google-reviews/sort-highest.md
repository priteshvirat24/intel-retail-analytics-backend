        "comment": "We traveled to NYC to watch The Christmas Spectacular at the Radio City Music Hall and stayed at the Hilton for the night. We loved the location as it was within of 5 minute walking distance of literally everything there is to see at Christmas time. Our room was quite spacious and clean with two full beds and a nice view. Staff was friendly and I loved that you can get there early and check in your bags so you can go explore before check in time as we arrived to the city around noon. Also loved that there was parking on site. We used the valet so you pulled in, got everything out you would need, they give you a card with a number and you walk into the doors and right to the luggage storage area. The elevator system is insane and that's my only complaint. I've never stayed in a hotel where you have to put in your room number and can only ride a certain elevator to your room. Seemed our elevators were always the ones with tons of people waiting to get on or off. The only outside noise you could hear were horns, but I was ok with that and thankful I never heard my neighbors or anyone in the halls. I got an insane discount on my room through my employer otherwise I would never be able to stay here during Christmastime. But I understand why the rate is so high as it is a hotel that sits in the middle of all the amazing attractions NYC has to offer. Would definitely stay here again!"

        "comment": "Absolutely the best stay in the world! My room was clean and quiet and had everything I needed. The room was much bigger than I expected for NYC. Shout out to housekeeping who didn’t make a peep in the hallways as they cleaned the vacant rooms. I didn’t leave until around 2pm so they were working hard. Many hotels (even the best of the best) have housekeepers who talk too loudly in the hallways and constantly slam doors. Not here! They were perfect and I didn’t even know they were there until I left. Can’t tell you how much I appreciate that. Tons of security and police presence for the upcoming celebration (New Year’s) or maybe it’s always like that here. Felt extremely safe and protected. Beautiful spacious clean sparkling lobby. Many upscale shops and stores I didn’t have time to visit. Glistening with inviting items to purchase and view. Wish I would have gone into the shops! The staff was very very friendly from the front desk to the security guard who answered all my questions last night about transportation to JFK and local things to visit near the hotel. The man mopping the floor was super friendly (this was around 1am) trying to give me directions for the subway train etc for the next day to JFK. I had the best latte from the wonderful friendly cafe near the lobby. Everything clean and welcoming and beautifully displayed. I decided to take a taxi to JFK\nand asked for a “nice” taxi driver. The gentleman supervising the taxi line immediately made way for me through the throngs of folks on the street and treated me like a celebrity as he directed me to the next available ride. He didn’t laugh at me and I did get the nicest taxi driver - Fabian!!!  I was given excellent directions to get to the airport in JFK by the transportation and show tickets desk and they explained how to take the train bus subway etc but it seemed a little more difficult than I was in the mood for. The energy out on the street was electric and I also wish I had walked around a little before I left the city. This hotel is convenient to everything! Can’t ask for anything more than the wonderful experience I had at this hotel. Thank you everyone who works there and outside and Happy New Year!!!",

I’m currently staying here, and everything has been fantastic so far. What truly sets this place apart is the incredible housekeeping team on the 34th floor.\n\nThey are, without a doubt, the most attentive and genuinely kind crew I’ve encountered in any hotel across the country. Always cheerful, always ready to help—even when I’ve had the “Do Not Disturb” sign up, they’ve gone out of their way to check in if they see me in the hallway, just to make sure I don’t need anything. That level of care and consistency is rare, and it deserves to be celebrated.\n\nThey’re simply the best.",
        "review_reply": "Dear Olaoluwa,\nThank you for taking the time to share this, especially since you mentioned you rarely write reviews.

The rooms are spacious, clean, and comfortable, and the staff is very friendly.\nThere can be a bit of a wait for the elevators, which is slightly inconvenient, but nothing too bothersome. The location is perfect, right in the center of New York, with taxis always available and plenty of restaurants and shops around.\nA nice extra perk: $35 per day to spend at the hotel’s restaurants.

It's in the heart of Midtown, convenient to Central Park and a host of subway holes to get to the rest of the city.  A good home base for your stay.\n\nIt's a huge hotel with a lot of rooms, so be prepared to wait to check in/out.\n\nThe room (queen, city view, 27th floor) was a normal room with little amenities included, and that was an upgrade. But again, it's location, location, location.\n\nThe Executive Lounge is also basic, but the staff is too notch. Super friendly and attentive. Plus it's a good place to stock up on waters and fruit before your daily excursions. Or to stop in for Happy Hour to grab a snack before a proper dinner.\n\nThe gym is massive. So many bikes, treadmills, ellipticals and stations. Honestly one of the biggest gyms I have seen in a hotel.",
