# Scraper Studio IDE interface reference

> Reference for the Bright Data Scraper Studio JavaScript IDE: templates, stages, debug tabs, input controls, 2 worker settings and the Self-Healing tool.

The Bright Data Scraper Studio IDE is the browser-based JavaScript editor where you write, test, and debug custom scrapers. This page is a reference for every panel, control, and dashboard action you see in the IDE, with links to the guides that show each feature in use.

## What the IDE panel contains

The IDE panel is where you write and test your scraper code. Each labeled component below corresponds to a section of the IDE interface.

### A - Templates

A library of pre-built scraper code created by Bright Data's engineers, covering common websites and scraping patterns. Templates are starting points and may require adjustments if a target website's structure has changed.

### B - Stages

Stages allow a scraper to operate across multiple steps in sequence. Each stage receives input from the previous one via next\_stage() or run\_stage(). Use stages when scraping requires navigating across multiple page types - for example, collecting URLs from a listing page, then extracting details from each URL.

> See [Scraper Studio functions](/datasets/scraper-studio/functions) for the full command reference.

### C - Functions reference

An in-IDE reference panel listing all available scraping functions with descriptions and usage examples.

> See [Interaction functions](/datasets/scraper-studio/functions#interaction-functions) and [Parser functions](/datasets/scraper-studio/functions#parser-functions).

### D - Debugging tabs

| Tab                 | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Input**           | Define input parameters and select an input set to run a preview test                                                                                                  |
| **Output**          | Structured data returned by the scraper after a preview run                                                                                                            |
| **Children**        | Input sets passed to the next stage in a multi-stage scraper                                                                                                           |
| **Run log**         | Full code execution log for the most recent preview                                                                                                                    |
| **Browser network** | Browser-level network activity log (equivalent to DevTools > Network tab)                                                                                              |
| **Last errors**     | The most recent error messages, including error codes and affected inputs (last 1,000 stored)                                                                          |
| **Crawl inspector** | All pages crawled during a batch job, including successes and failures. For multi-stage scrapers, use **Search for children** to view pages generated from each parent |
| **Output schema**   | Field names and data types for the scraper's output. Click **Edit Schema** to modify input or output schema                                                            |

### Preview output modes

When you run a preview, the Output tab can show results in two modes:

**Raw output** - shows the records exactly as they were collected by the scraper code, before schema formatting or processing is applied.

**Formatted output** - shows the records after they are processed according to the output schema, including field types, formatting rules, default values, validation, and other schema settings.

Use Raw output when debugging parser code or checking what collect() returned.

Use Formatted output when verifying the final structure that will be delivered in production runs.

For example, a price field may appear as raw text in Raw output, but as a structured price object or formatted value in Formatted output, depending on the output schema configuration.

### E - Input

| Control                 | Description                                   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Add input parameter** | Define a new input parameter by name and type |
| **New input**           | Add a value to an input set for testing       |
| **Preview**             | Run the scraper against a selected input set  |

### F - Settings

| Setting              | Description                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Worker**           | Select Browser Worker or Code Worker for this scraper                                          |
| **Error mode**       | Define scraper behavior when an error occurs                                                   |
| **Take screenshot**  | Capture screenshots of loaded pages during preview runs                                        |
| **Worker per stage** | Assign a different worker type to each stage instead of using one worker for the whole scraper |

> See [Worker types](/datasets/scraper-studio/worker-types) for guidance on choosing between Browser worker and Code worker.

### G - Self-Healing Tool

AI-powered code refactor. Accepts plain-language prompts to fix errors or modify input/output fields without manual code editing.

> See [Self-Healing tool](/datasets/scraper-studio/self-healing-tool).

### H - Preview

**Preview** runs the scraper code against the input selected in the **Input** tab at the bottom-left of the IDE. Use it to test your interaction and parser logic before saving the scraper to production. Preview results appear in the **Output** debugging tab.

Scraper Studio provides two preview modes:

* **Preview (browser)**, runs the scraper in an interactive browser view. Use this mode to inspect page behavior, clicks, scrolling, JavaScript rendering, and browser-only interactions.
* **HTML**, shows the loaded page HTML or response content used by the parser. Use this mode to debug selectors, parser logic, and extracted fields.

## Scraper Dashboard Menu

The Dashboard lists all your scrapers under **My Scrapers**. Each scraper has an action menu with the following options:

| Action                   | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
