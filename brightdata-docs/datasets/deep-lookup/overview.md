## Understanding Column Types

When building your research in Preview Mode, you'll work with two types of columns:

### How enrich columns work

**Purpose:** Add new attributes to each result using data from the public web.

These columns provide additional information about your entities without filtering results. For example:

* CEO name for a company
* Revenue figures
* Contact information
* Social media profiles
* Technology stack used

### How filter columns work

**Purpose:** Limit results by applying specific conditions to your query.

These columns determine which records are included in your dataset. For example:

* Companies with revenue greater than \$10 million
* Professionals with 5+ years experience
* Products priced under \$100
* Articles published in the last 30 days

## Understanding "Skipped" Results

When you see "skipped" in a cell, it means the candidate entity did not match at least one of your filter criteria. This is how Deep Lookup ensures precision in your results.

### Important Points About Skipped Results:

* **More filters = fewer results**: The more filters you apply, the more precise your results become, but you may get fewer total matches
* **Each filter must be satisfied**: All filter conditions must be met for an entity to be included
* **Optimization tip**: If you're getting too many skipped results, consider removing some filters to broaden your search
* **Quality over quantity**: Skipped results ensure you only pay for data that exactly matches your criteria

### Example:

If you search for "Find all SaaS companies in California with >100 employees AND revenue >\$10M AND founded after 2020":

* A company with 150 employees and \$15M revenue but founded in 2019 would be skipped
* Only companies meeting ALL criteria appear in your final results

## Deep Lookup Modes

### Preview Mode (Recommended)

The best way to ensure accurate results before spending credits:

* **Free preview results** - Get up to 10 sample records at no cost to understand expected outcomes
* **Query refinement** - Deep Lookup's AI assistant helps you refine and improve query accuracy
* **Column customization** - Review and adjust column names, types, and specifications before running
* **Specs panel control** - Tweak column settings, reorder fields, change types, or add new columns

### When to use Instant Mode

For fast, one-shot results when you know exactly what you need:

* Run queries immediately for simple, well-defined searches
* Best for repeat queries with proven parameters

### When to use Advanced Mode

For complex, multi-step research:

* Build sophisticated queries with multiple refinement steps

## Writing Effective Queries

### The Basic Structure

Start every query with "Find all" and describe exactly what you need:

```text theme={null}
Find all B2B SaaS companies in Texas with revenue greater 
than $10 million and less than 100 employees founded after 2020
```

### Key Success Tips

**1. Use Natural Language Comparisons**

* "greater than 50 employees"
* "less than \$5 million in revenue"
* "between 100 and 500 employees"

**2. Specify Geographic Boundaries**

* "in California"
* "headquartered in London"
* "operating in Southeast Asia"

**3. Add Revenue or Size Constraints**

* "with annual revenue greater than \$20 million"
* "having between 50 and 200 employees"

**4. Combine 2-4 Specific Criteria**
The sweet spot for queries is combining a few specific requirements

**5. Include Industry-Specific Terms**

* For tech: "SaaS", "API-first", "cloud-native"
* For finance: "Series B funded", "EBITDA positive"
* For retail: "D2C", "omnichannel", "subscription-based"
