# FAQ: Archive API

> FAQs about the Bright Data Archive API: Over ~115 PB of archived data, 4 delivery destinations and CPM pricing of $0.2 to $1 per thousand pages.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Archive API?">
    Archive API is a massive, continuously expanding, cached repository by Bright Data, designed to capture and deliver public web data at scale.

    It provides full web pages and metadata, making it ideal for AI training, machine learning, and large-scale data analysis.

    Unlike traditional web crawls, Archive API prioritizes **relevance**, **freshness**, and **usability**, giving you access to the most important parts of the internet as they are scraped daily.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much data is available?">
    As of August 2026, the Bright Data Archive holds over\~**115 PB** across **\~800 billion pages** from **\~380 million domains**, and keeps growing.

    Collection runs continuously, so the totals grow every day:

    | Window        | Pages added    |
    | ------------- | -------------- |
    | Last 24 hours | \~1.6 billion  |
    | Last 7 days   | \~11.9 billion |
    | Last 30 days  | \~48.2 billion |

    That growth rate makes Archive the largest up-to-date web data repository available for AI and data-driven applications.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How quickly can I access the data?">
    You can start accessing data immediately through our [Archive API](/datasets/archive/overview). The API allows you to search, retrieve and filter data snapshots from Archive seamlessly and efficiently.

    * Data from the last 24 hours: Will take from within minutes and up to a few hours to deliver (depending on snapshot size)
    * Data older than 24 hours: Will take up to 48 hours to process and start delivery (depending on snapshot size)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does Archive API cost?">
    Archive API is priced by data age and billed per CPM, meaning cost per thousand pages.

    | Data age            | Price       |
    | ------------------- | ----------- |
    | Last 24 hours       | \$0.2 / CPM |
    | Older than 24 hours | \$1 / CPM   |

    Before you run a dump, `GET /webarchive/search/{search_id}` returns `dump_cost_usd` for that search, plus a `cost_breakdown` object splitting the estimate between cache pages and archive pages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can my data be delivered?">
    Archive API offers four delivery destinations:

    * **Amazon S3 bucket:** Have your Data Snapshot delivered directly to your S3 bucket.
    * **Azure Blob Storage:** Deliver the data snapshot directly to your Azure Blob container.
    * **Google Cloud Storage:** Deliver the data snapshot directly to your GCS bucket.
    * **Webhook:** Retrieved via webhook for real-time integration into your systems.

    Webhook delivery is not suitable for large dumps, which can reach 1 GB. See [Deliver to cloud](/api-reference/archive-api/deliver-to-cloud) for the settings each destination requires.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I filter Archive's data to get only what I need?">
    Absolutely! Archive API allows filtering by category, domains, date, languages, and country before retrieving data, ensuring you only get what you need.

  <Accordion title="How does Bright Data's Archive compare to Common Crawl?">
    When working with large-scale web data, **freshness**, **relevance**, and **accessibility** are key.
