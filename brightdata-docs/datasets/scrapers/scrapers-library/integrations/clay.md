1. **Log in to Clay**:

   * Log into your Clay account.

   * Navigate to the Workflows section.

2. **Set Up a Trigger**:

   * Choose how you'd like to trigger the workflow (e.g., manually, scheduled, or based on an event in another service integrated with Clay).

3. **Add an HTTP Request Action**:

   * Add an HTTP request block to your workflow.

   * Select the HTTP method supported by your Scrapers (POST "[Trigger a collection](/api-reference/scrapers/delivery-apis/download-snapshot)").

4. **Configure the Request**:

   * In the HTTP request block, input the following:

   * Headers: Include any required headers, such as:

   ```JSON theme={null}
     {
         "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
         "Content-Type": "application/json"
     }
   ```

   * Body (if required): Add any parameters required in the body as JSON.

### Step 3: Process the Response in Clay

Once you’ve successfully connected to the Scrapers, you can process the response data:

1. **Integrate with Other Services**:

   * Use Clay to send the data to a database, Google Sheets, email, or any other service.

2. **Add Conditions/Logic**:

   * Create conditions or filters in your workflow. For example, only process items with a price above a certain threshold.
