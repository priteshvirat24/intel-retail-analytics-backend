# Success rate alerts for scrapers

> Configure per-scraper email alerts in the Bright Data Control Panel for any of 1000+ scrapers when a Web Scraper API success rate drops or recovers.

## Why this is good (and why it matters)

* Faster time-to-detection: Instead of discovering issues after a workflow breaks (or after opening a ticket), you get notified as soon as SR degrades.
* More production-ready monitoring: Your team can react quickly to failures or partial degradation and reduce downtime for data pipelines.
* Clarity instead of a “black box”: SR changes are surfaced proactively, so you don't need to constantly check dashboards to know if a scraper is struggling.
* Automatic recovery signal: You get a second email when SR returns to normal - useful for closing incidents and restoring paused jobs.

## How to set up Success Rate (SR) email alerts for a Web Scraper API scraper

This guide shows you how to configure email notifications in the Control Panel so your team gets alerted when a scraper's SR drops below a threshold - and when it recovers.

## What SR email alerts do

Once enabled per scraper, SR alerts send:

* Drop alert: An email when the scraper's Success Rate falls below the threshold you set (example: below 25%).
* Recovery alert: A second email when the scraper's Success Rate rises back above that same threshold.
  You can select one or multiple recipients from the email addresses available in your Control Panel settings.

<Note>
  **Default behavior**: By default, alerts are configured to notify only if the scraper is in outage. You can manually increase the threshold from the scraper page to detect issues earlier (before a full outage).
</Note>

## Configure SR alerts (per scraper)

1. Open the Control Panel and go to Scrapers ([https://brightdata.com/cp/scrapers](https://brightdata.com/cp/scrapers)).
2. Select the scraper you want to monitor.
3. In the scraper page, find Success Rate (SR) email alerts (notification settings).

5. Set the SR threshold (example: 25%).
6. Select recipients (one or multiple email addresses).
7. Save your changes.

| :------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No recipients to choose from     | No emails are defined/available in Control Panel Settings                  | Add/verify email addresses in Control Panel Settings, then return to the scraper and select them |
| Not receiving alerts             | Alerts aren't enabled for that scraper, or the threshold isn't appropriate | Re-check the scraper's SR alerts toggle, threshold value, and click Save                         |
| You only get outage-level alerts | Threshold is still at the default “outage only” behavior                   | Increase the threshold manually on the scraper page                                              |
