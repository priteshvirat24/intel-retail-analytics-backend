## How it works

You send one or more Reddit URLs or keywords to the Bright Data Reddit Scraper API. Bright Data handles the scraping infrastructure and returns clean, structured JSON.

```text theme={null}
Your app  -->  Bright Data API  -->  Structured JSON
           POST /datasets/v3/scrape
           Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

All requests use a `dataset_id` to specify the data type (posts or comments) and return results in JSON, NDJSON or CSV.

## Which endpoints are available

The Reddit Scraper API exposes two dataset families. Each family supports one or more input shapes.

## Common questions

<Accordion title="Is the data scraped in real time?">
  Yes. Each request triggers a live scrape against Reddit. There is no cached or stale data. Response times vary by endpoint: Collect-by-URL requests typically return in 10 to 30 seconds, while discovery requests may take longer depending on result volume.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the difference between Collect and Discover?">
  **Collect by URL** scrapes a specific Reddit page you provide, a single post, a comment thread or a subreddit. **Discover** finds Reddit posts matching search criteria such as a keyword or a subreddit listing, then scrapes the results. Discovery is most useful via async requests when you don't know the exact URLs up front.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I collect only recent comments from a post?">
  Yes. The Comments API accepts an optional `days_back` parameter. Pass an integer to limit results to comments posted within that many days.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How is this different from scraping using proxies or Web Unlocker?">
  When scraping using proxies or Web Unlocker, you still need to write and maintain your own parsing logic and update it whenever Reddit changes its page structure. The Reddit Scraper API handles the entire stack: proxy rotation, anti-bot bypassing and parsing. You simply send a Reddit URL or keyword and get clean, structured JSON back with no scraping infrastructure or parser maintenance required on your end.
