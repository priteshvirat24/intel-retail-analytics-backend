</Tip>

## How it works

You send one or more Google URLs, keywords or structured inputs to the Bright Data Google Scraper API. Bright Data handles proxies, CAPTCHAs and parsing, then returns clean JSON.

```text theme={null}
Your app  -->  Bright Data API  -->  Structured JSON
           POST /datasets/v3/scrape
           Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

All requests use a `dataset_id` to specify the Google product and return results in JSON, NDJSON, JSON Lines or CSV.

## Which dataset IDs to use

Each Google product uses its own `dataset_id`. Pass the ID as a query parameter on every request.

## Request methods

The Google Scraper API supports two request methods. Choose based on your volume and latency needs.

| Method           | Endpoint                                                  | Best for                                                |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Synchronous**  | [`/scrape`](/datasets/scrapers/google/send-first-request) | Real-time lookups, up to 20 inputs                      |
| **Asynchronous** | [`/trigger`](/datasets/scrapers/google/async-requests)    | Batch jobs, 20+ inputs, discovery, production pipelines |

## Common questions

<Accordion title="Is the data scraped in real time?">
  Yes. Each request triggers a live scrape against Google. There is no cached or stale data. Response times vary by endpoint: Collect-by-URL requests typically return in 10 to 30 seconds, while discovery requests may take longer depending on result volume.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the difference between Collect and Discover?">
  **Collect by URL** scrapes a specific Google page you provide, such as a single Maps place, a Shopping product or a SERP URL. **Discover** finds Google records matching search criteria such as a keyword, a CID or a geographic area, then scrapes the results. Discovery is most useful via async requests when you don't know the exact URLs up front.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I target a specific country or language?">
  Yes. Most endpoints accept a `country` parameter (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code), and the SERP 100 endpoint also accepts `language` and `uule` for geographic targeting. See each endpoint's reference page for the full parameter list.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How is this different from scraping using proxies or Web Unlocker?">
  When scraping with proxies or Web Unlocker, you still need to write and maintain your own parsing logic and update it whenever Google changes its page structure. The Google Scraper API handles the entire stack: proxy rotation, anti-bot bypassing and parsing. You send a URL or keyword and get clean, structured JSON back with no scraping infrastructure or parser maintenance on your end.
