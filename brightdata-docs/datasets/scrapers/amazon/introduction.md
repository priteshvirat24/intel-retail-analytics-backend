</Tip>

## How it works

You send one or more Amazon URLs to the Bright Data Amazon Scraper API. Bright Data handles the scraping infrastructure and returns clean, structured JSON.

```text theme={null}
Your app  -->  Bright Data API  -->  Structured JSON
           POST /datasets/v3/scrape
           Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

All requests use a `dataset_id` to specify the data type (products, reviews, sellers, global products, or search) and return results in JSON, NDJSON, or CSV.

## What the response looks like

```bash theme={null}
curl -X POST "https://api.brightdata.com/datasets/v3/scrape?dataset_id=gd_l7q7dkf244hwjntr0&format=json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{"url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHHSFMRL"}]'
```

```json theme={null}
{
  "title": "Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation)",
  "asin": "B0CHHSFMRL",
  "price": 189.99,
  "currency": "USD",
  "rating": 4.7,
  "reviews_count": 85420,
  "seller_name": "Amazon.com",
  "brand": "Apple",
  "availability": "In Stock",
  "main_image": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/...",
  "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHHSFMRL"
}

## Common questions

<Accordion title="Is the data scraped in real time?">
  Yes. Each request triggers a live scrape. There is no cached or stale data. Response times vary by endpoint: products typically return in 10-30 seconds (sync), while discovery requests may take longer depending on result volume.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the difference between URL collection and discovery?">
  **URL collection** scrapes a specific Amazon page you provide (e.g., a product URL). **Discovery** finds Amazon content matching search criteria (e.g., all products in a category or matching a keyword) and scrapes the results. Discovery is only available via async requests.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How is this different from scraping using proxies or Web Unlocker?">
  When scraping using proxies or Web Unlocker, you still need to write and maintain your own parsing logic and update it whenever Amazon changes its page structure. The Amazon Scraper API handles the entire stack: proxy rotation, anti-bot bypassing and parsing. You simply send an Amazon URL and get clean, structured JSON back with no scraping infrastructure or parser maintenance required on your end.
