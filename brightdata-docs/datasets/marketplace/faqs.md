    The datasets marketplace is continously updated with fresh datasets. For the complete list, click on "Datasets" on the sidebar, and then on "Dataset marketplace" on the top bar.

    If the domains you need aren't exist in the Marketplace, you can request them through the Custom Dataset (CDS).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you offer any free datasets?">
    Yes! you can download a few free datasets:

    * espn.com - NBA data
    * goodreads.com
    * imdb.com
    * worldpopulationreview\.com

    The datasets marketplace is continously updated with fresh datasets. For the complete list, click on “Datasets” on the sidebar, and then on “Dataset marketplace” on the top bar.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why does the timestamp differ from the delivery date in the marketplace dataset?">
    The schedule run is designed to ensure timely delivery.

    The delivery deadline is calculated based on previous collection cycles and the estimated refresh duration.

    Therefore, the collection may start earlier than the delivery date to guarantee that the data is delivered on time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I see data snapshots that are ready?">
    You can find your data snapshots under the "My datasets" tab. There, you'll see a table with information about each snapshot, including its status: ready, failed, or in building.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What do I do with the Snapshot ID?">
    A Snapshot ID is a unique identifier assigned to a specific data snapshot, formatted as "snap\_XXXXXX".

    You should use the Snapshot ID whenever there is an issue with a particular data snapshot. Including this ID in your support ticket helps the support team quickly identify the exact snapshot in question, leading to faster issue resolution. You can open a support ticket from the **Tickets** tab in the **Datasets** section of the Control Panel.

    The Snapshot ID ensures that both you and the support team are referring to the same data set, reducing confusion and delays in addressing your problem.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you set the record limit?">
    You can set a record limit in two ways:

    **Using the control panel:** Before purchasing a dataset, click “Proceed to purchase.” On the “Choose delivery frequency” page, select the “Too pricey? Limit dataset records” option to specify your desired record limit.

    **Through the Filter API:** Add a parameter to limit the number of records returned by the API. For reference, see: [Dataset Filter API - records\_limit](/api-reference/marketplace-dataset-api/filter-dataset#body-records-limit).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is a commitment cost for the Dataset (Filter) API?">
    Currently, there is no monthly commitment or minimum order of \$250 required when using the Dataset Filter API. You only pay based on your actual record consumption.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I ran a filter request and was charged before buying the data. What's going on?">
    When you submit a dataset filter API request, compute resources are used to identify records matching your filter criteria. If matching records are found, you will be charged based on the amount of these matched records. However, if no matching records are found, you will not be charged. To avoid charges while exploring your filter criteria, you can test filters through the dataset preview table in the control panel, which offers up to 10 free filters per day.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why are some fields not fully fillable?">
    Some fields may have lower fill rates due to limitations or gaps in the publicly available source data. Fill rates vary depending on dataset type and source quality - which can result in partial coverage for specific attributes. We provide detailed fill rates and statistics for each dataset to help you evaluate completeness before purchasing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I need datasets">

  <Accordion title="What is the API rate limit?">
    The Filter API rate limit is 120 requests per hour. This applies to all API calls and snapshot triggers within the specified time frame. Note: Plan your API calls accordingly to stay within the hourly limit. Consider implementing retry logic with exponential backoff for optimal performance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the maximum number of values I can send to the API filters?">
    You can send up to 10,000 input lines per uploaded CSV or JSON file when using list filters or include filters. There is no limit on the number of files per request, and a request can total up to 200 MiB. See the [Filter dataset limits](/api-reference/marketplace-dataset-api/filter-dataset) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the maximum input file size for the API?">
    The maximum input file size is 200 MiB for any single API request. Warning: Files exceeding 200 MiB will be rejected. Compress your data or split large files into smaller chunks before submission.

  <Accordion title="Where do I get a Snapshot ID?">
    Snapshot IDs are returned when you [Trigger Collection](/api-reference/rest-api/scraper/asynchronous-requests) (POST `/datasets/v3/trigger`), [Filter Dataset](/api-reference/marketplace-dataset-api/filter-dataset-with-csv-json-files) (POST `/datasets/filter`), or via a dataset subscription. You can also [list all your snapshots](/api-reference/scrapers/management-apis/get-snapshots) with GET `/datasets/v3/snapshots`.

    > See "[Before you begin](/api-reference/marketplace-dataset-api/deliver-snapshot#before-you-begin)" for more details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What do I do with the delivery job ID in the response?">
    The `id` in the response is a delivery job ID. Use it to track delivery progress by calling GET `/datasets/v3/delivery/{delivery_id}`. Poll until status is "done".

    > See [Tracking delivery status](/api-reference/marketplace-dataset-api/deliver-snapshot#tracking-delivery-status) for more details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does the snapshot need to be in a specific status?">
    Yes. The snapshot must be in `ready` status. Check with GET `/datasets/snapshots/{id}` before calling deliver.

    > Possible statuses: `scheduled`, `building`, `ready`, `failed`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I deliver the same snapshot to multiple destinations?">
    Yes. Call this endpoint multiple times with different delivery configurations for the same snapshot ID.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What file formats are supported?">
    json, jsonl, ndjson, csv, xlsx, and parquet. See [Data delivery and export](/datasets/marketplace/data-delivery-and-export) for per-destination details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I split large snapshots into smaller files?">
    Use the `batch_size` parameter to set the number of records per file. Each file (batch) must stay under the 5GB hard limit. Estimate `batch_size` by dividing 5GB by your average record size, then start lower and adjust based on the actual file size you get.

    For example, if your average record is \~5KB, a `batch_size` of 1,000,000 records lands right at the \~5GB limit. Start at 500,000 records (\~2.5GB) to stay safely under, then raise or lower `batch_size` based on the file size you receive.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why did my request return a 400 error?">
    The most common cause is that your `batch_size` produces a file larger than 5GB. For example, if your average record size is \~5KB, a `batch_size` of 1,000,000 produces a \~5GB file that may exceed the limit. Lower your `batch_size` (e.g., to 100,000) and retry.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I compress the output?">
    Yes. Set `compress: true` to receive gzip-compressed files.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the maximum file size per batch?">
    5GB. This is a hard limit per delivered file. Use `batch_size` to control how many records go into each file and ensure each stays under this threshold.
  </Accordion>
