  <Accordion title="Can I limit my daily usage?">
    Yes.

    In the [Zone](https://brightdata.com/cp/zones) page under the "Usage spent limit" column it is possible to limit your daily usage in 2 ways:

    * Bandwidth(bytes)
    * Money spent(Dollars)

    When you reach your daily limit, the zone is suspended, alerted, or both, depending on your configuration.

    </Frame>

    <Tip>
      The Zone limit is calculated every 15 minutes and will not take effect immediately so a Zone might go over it's limit by 15 minutes of usage.
    </Tip>

    <Note>
      When the load is high statistics calculation may have a delay. In order to manually update the usage-statistics in your Zone, open the Zone by clicking on its name, go to the Statistics table, and press the `recalc` button near the desired date. Wait until the red "Loading..." notification at the top of the screen will disappear, and refresh the page. The stats will then be up-to-date.

Billing is precise and measured down to the megabyte (MB), with no rounding up of bandwidth usage.
