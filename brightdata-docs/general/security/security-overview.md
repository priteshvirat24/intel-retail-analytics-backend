## Security for AI Agents & MCP Users

Bright Data's MCP Server and Browser API operate under the same certified security infrastructure described on this page.

<Warning>
  Always treat scraped web content as **untrusted input**. Validate and filter data before passing it to an LLM prompt to mitigate prompt injection risks.
</Warning>

**Recommended practices when using Bright Data in agentic workflows:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Treat web content as untrusted">
    Validate and filter web data before passing it to an LLM prompt - this mitigates prompt injection attacks.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use structured extraction tools">
    Prefer `web_data_*` tools where available - they return pre-validated, schema-consistent data.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Store credentials securely">
    Store API keys as environment variables. Never hardcode credentials in agent code or prompts.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Scope API key permissions">
    Use API key permission scoping (five levels available) to enforce least-privilege access from your agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>
