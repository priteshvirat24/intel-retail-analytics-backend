# Bright Data network security

> How Bright Data secures its virtual ISP network across 4 layers: registration requirements, DDoS prevention, domain denylisting and traffic monitoring.

Most of the traffic that goes through both a regular ISP and a virtual ISP is encrypted with an SSL tunnel so its content is not visible to the ISP. Due to this the methods to secure the network and prevent illegal activities available to ISPs are limited and are mostly targeted at large scale DDoS prevention and domain denylists. However at Bright Data we do a lot more:

> **Bottom line**\
> Bright Data virtual ISP network is much safer and less likely to be used for attacks and abuse than a regular ISP.
