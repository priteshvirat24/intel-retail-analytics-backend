# Bright Data general FAQs

> FAQs about Bright Data accounts: proxy credentials, port 44445, SSL certificates and IP management across all proxy and API products.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Where is my proxy username and password?">
    You can find your username and password for your Bright Data product (e.g. proxy, Web Unlocker API, Browser API etc) in the "Overview" tab for product you created. You can create more than one password if you want.

    **Note**: the username and password you created for the Bright Data site are **NOT** used for accessing the actual products. It is only used for dashboard access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which proxy service port shall I use: 22225 or 33335?">
    In Bright Data we distinguish between our proxy service ports, to which you address your requests and the target ports which refer to the target website or host you are trying to reach.

    This entry refers to Proxy service ports, of our main host: [brd.superproxy.io](http://brd.superproxy.io)

    #### Proxy port

    When working with Bright Data proxies in Native mode, you need to provide a proxy port. This setting is redundant when working with proxy APIs - see more here of the differences between [API vs. native Access](/api-reference/authentication).

    #### Proxy port transition

    Bright Data now serves requests over native proxy port `44445`, introduced with the new root certificate in July 2026. The old certificates on ports `22225` and `33335` expire on September 25, 2026 at 00:00 UTC, and traffic still relying on them after that date will fail. For a step-by-step move, see the [root certificate migration guide](/general/account/ssl-certificate-migration).

    For proxy zones of types **Residential, Mobile, Web Unlocker API and SERP API** which require either [KYC](/proxy-networks/residential/network-access#kyc-verification) or [SSL Certificate](/general/account/ssl-certificate) it is essential to install the correct certificate which complies with port used.

    If you are still using port `22225` or `33335`, complete the transition to port `44445` before September 25, 2026.

    #### Supported settings

    | Port    | Certificate                  | Expiration               |
    | ------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
    | `44445` | New certificate (required)   | In effect from July 2026 |
    | `33335` | Old certificate (deprecated) | September 25, 2026       |
    | `22225` | Old certificate (deprecated) | September 25, 2026       |

    #### Working in Tandem

    The certificates operate in tandem and differ by port, so you can migrate gracefully. Use the certificate that matches the port you connect to. Port `44445` uses `brightdata_root_ca_44445.crt`.

    ### Transition steps

    To transition to port `44445` you should:

    1. Inform your network administrator or security administrator to open the domain `brd.superproxy.io` on port `44445` for outgoing communication.
    2. If you are using certificate: install the new certificate. See instructions on certificate installation here: [SSL Certificate](/general/account/ssl-certificate)

  <Accordion title="How do I set up a password for my account?">
    Even if you first signed in with 'magic link' or using a six-digit code, you can always create a password for your account. You can then save the password in your browser for faster access to the control panel.

    To set up a password for your Bright Data account, follow these steps:

    1. Access authentication settings: Click on "Settings" and go to the ['Passwords & authentication' tab](https://brightdata.com/cp/setting/auth)
    2. Create your password: Follow the instructions to create a password for your account. We recommend at least a 10-digit password with numbers and symbols.

    Remember, each user must set their own password. If you have other users on your account, they can configure their passwords individually if needed.

    Note: If you're authenticated via third-party service like Google or GitHub, please add a separate user and sign in through Bright Data's standard signup flow instead of using third-party services.

  <Accordion title="How do I calculate the Cost effectiveness of residential IPs?">
    <img src="https://mintcdn.com/brightdata/hiKWnoPeUYwLvmyy/images/general/faqs/cost-limits-table.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=hiKWnoPeUYwLvmyy&q=85&s=36ac2f0f007d771badb7ddb8335ca77e" alt="cost-limits-table.png" width="680" height="369" data-path="images/general/faqs/cost-limits-table.png" />

    **How did we calculate this table?**

    Your company needs to collect information from the web by sending 1,000 http requests per hour to a specific website. You write the scraper code and run it through a server. The target website allows 50 requests per minute from the same IP before blocking your scraper. Now, you have to purchase more proxies.

    **Assuming you choose datacenter proxies:**\
    You don't want to share IPs, so you buy 200 dedicated data-center IPs. You code the integration of the scraper with the new data-center proxies for 2 hours and then run the new program. This time, it takes 3 days for your target website to detect your scraper. Once your proxies are detected, you'll have to purchase new proxies and repeat this process again, checking each day to make sure the proxies haven't been detected. Cost per month (all numbers are from real customers):

    * 200 dedicated IPs: \$500
    * Bandwidth: (1000 request X 20KB per request X 24 hours X 30 days = 14.5GB): \$3 per month
    * Developer (2 hours integration X 10 + 1 hour every 3 days for managing the proxies): \~3 days of work a month or \~\$900

    Your total cost per month will be at least \$1400 for just these things alone, and the salary of \$30 per hour for a developer is very conservative. Additionally, this doesn't account for a lack of information reliability if your target website sends misinformation before blocking you or if your information flow is cut every few days, which can be detrimental to your brand or your revenue stream.

    **Assuming you choose Bright Data residential proxies:** You buy a basic package of 40GB with access to unlimited residential IPs. It takes 2 hours to integrate your scraper. Due to Bright Data's pool of 400M+ residential IPs, your target website can't detect your scraper, allowing you to focus on other projects.

    The bandwidth and unlimited IPs cost just \$500 per month. Your information is always reliable because your requests are always successful and access is never cut in the middle of the month. When your business grows as a result of this scraping and your projects exceed 600MB each month, the difference in costs can be much higher than just \~\$1000.

    Bright Data also allows you to suspend your account when not in use, so your cost can be lower than \$500 per month. Start by using the \$5 voucher for free data-center traffic to test Bright Data's benefits and then ask for access to our residential network for cheap and reliable data collection.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the yellow warning icon next to my zone name?">
    > **This is a reminder to setup your allowlist access**

    To restrict your proxy zone access from unauthorized servers, we recommend you setup an IP allowlist. This will ensure only IPs you recognize will be allowed to access your proxy zone, for higher security and control.

    Consult your IT or networking specialist to make sure your outgoing IP is fixed and does not change, otherwise you may block yourself or other authorized users from your company to access the proxy zone.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How to restrict access using Token-based Authentication">
    This workflow is optimal when using multiple crawlers with rotating IPs that target the Proxy Manager installed remotely. This method requires you API key an Authentication token.

    Run From inside the remote server the next command in Terminal/CMD

    ```sh theme={null}
    curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:22999/api/gen_token" -H "accept: application/json"
    ```

    This will generate an API key as an authentication token for you:

    ```sh Output theme={null}
    "token":"<API_KEY>"
    ```

    Now you can simply send a request using the API key you just created:

    ```sh theme={null}
    curl -x token:<API_KEY>@<remote-server-IP>:<Port> "target-site.com"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a way to know if my publicly-available data was collected by Bright Data's collection platform?">
    > **Yes**

    You can check if your public data was collected here: [https://brightdata.com/check\_your\_data](https://brightdata.com/check_your_data).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you only collect public data or do you also collect private data?">
    We never collect private data. We only collect publicly-available data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is Playground mode?">
    When you sign up, your account automatically enters a free trial "Playground mode" for the first 7 days, allowing you to instantly try different Bright Data solutions. No credit card or any other form of payment method is needed.

    Separately, every new account also gets a recurring [free tier](/general/account/billing-and-pricing/free-tier) of 5,000 credits per month for the Web Unlocker API, SERP API, Web Scraper API and Scraper Studio. These credits renew on the first of each month and do not expire with the trial.

    You can extend this free trial to **30 days** and **unlock Proxy and Web Unlocker API usage**. To do so and receive a \$5 free credit, [verify your account](https://brightdata.com/cp/billing_flow) to start our Limited 30-day trial. Note that the 30-day trial does not apply to certain countries.

    <Info>
      During Playground mode, **Proxy Networks** (Residential, Mobile, ISP, Datacenter) and **Web Unlocker API** are not available for accounts registered with personal email addresses and no payment method on file. Adding a payment method removes this restriction. See [Payment Verification](/general/account/billing-and-pricing/payment-verification).
    </Info>

    <Note>
      Playground mode is a free trial intended for small-scale testing and exploration, not for large-scale tests or production use. Product usage is subject to limitations such as speed, bandwidth, and requests per second until you [verify your account](https://brightdata.com/cp/billing_flow) and start our [Limited Trial](/general/faqs#what-is-limited-trial-mode).
    </Note>

    <Note>
      While operating in Playground mode (or any unfunded state), requests across the SERP API, Web Unlocker API and Proxies are subject to a default rate limit of 1,000 requests per minute. You can verify your current rate limit in the Control Panel, under the zone's Overview tab > Access details.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is Limited Trial mode?">
    **Limited Trial** mode if a free trial period that allows you to freely explore our Bright Data proxy solutions without immediate payment. You'll receive a \$5 credit to use any of our proxy services for a period of 30 days, giving you a full month to test and experience our offerings.

    Note that the 30-day trial does not apply to certain countries. If you don't see this option, add funds to your account to start using Bright Data - you can add as little as \$10 to get started with a Pay as You Go plan.

    #### How do I verify my account to start the “Limited Trial” and receive a \$5 credit?

    Account verification is simple and free. Just [add a valid payment method](https://brightdata.com/cp/billing_flow) to your account to start **Limited Trial** mode and receive your \$5 credit. You will not be charged.

    #### What happens after the 30-day trial?

    At the end of the 30-day trial period, your \$5 proxy trial credit expires (if not already used), and you will need to add funds to your account to keep using the proxy products. The recurring [free tier](/general/account/billing-and-pricing/free-tier) of 5,000 credits per month for the Web Unlocker API, SERP API, Web Scraper API and Scraper Studio is unaffected and continues to renew monthly.

    #### Can I use the free credit on any of your proxy products?

    Yes, the \$5 trial credit can be used on any of our proxy products during the duration of the trial, allowing you to test the products that best fit your needs.

  <Accordion title="Can I use Bright Data as a VPN for my PC?">
    Not really. Bright Data is a service for enterprise customers who want to collect public web data from the Internet, and is not designed for private users.

    In addition, using Bright Data does not encrypt your Internet traffic.

    If you want a free VPN, we recommend you check out [BrightVPN](https://brightvpn.com) - it is available for Windows and macOS.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use the direct Bright Data API to manage my account?">
    Yes, we have extensive coverage of actions that can be performed programmatically via code by using our direct API to manage your account and proxies/zones - you can perform actions like adding or deleting zones, managing IP allowlists/denylists, fetch a list of IPs allocated to your zone, get billing balance and so on. For more detailed and accurate information, please see our API documentation section - [Account Management API Documentation](/api-reference/account-management-api)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I add my company details to the invoice?">
    You can add your company details in the [Account Settings](https://brightdata.com/cp/setting/customer_details), and your monthly invoices will be addressed to your company automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I change/update the email address on my account?">
    You cannot directly "change" or "update" the email address in your account. But, you *can* create a new user with the new email address, and then delete the "old" user - this would achieve the same desired result as updating/changing/replacing your email address.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How to access proxies with IP allowlist only? (IP:PORT method)" defaultOpen="false">
    To gain access your proxies by IP allowlist authentication only (IP:PORT), without using the API key authentication method or the USERNAME:PASSWORD authentication method, you can utilize the [Proxy Manager](/proxy-networks/proxy-manager/introduction) tool.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much time does it take to get a KYC decision and how can I see my account verification status? ">
    It usually takes up to 2 business days to review your KYC request. However, if your submission does not include all the information, or the documentation submitted is unclear visually, outdated or incorrect the KYC can take longer.

    To check your account verification status browse to the control panel, under account settings -> Profile. In there you can see your verification status as one of: `not submitted` , `in progress` , `approved` or `denied`.

    Click this link to view the status: [https://brightdata.com/cp/setting/customer\_details](https://brightdata.com/cp/setting/customer_details)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use personal email for KYC?" defaultOpen="false">
    No, only company email addresses are accepted for KYC verification.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where can I see the legal restrictions and policies of Bright Data?" defaultOpen="false">
    To see our legal restrictions and policies, please see the following page: [Bright Data Master Service Agreement](https://brightdata.com/license)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I contact Bright Data Support/Account Manager/Sales/Compliance? " defaultOpen="false">
    If you need to reach out to our staff, you can do that either through the Help & Support section in the control panel - in the top right section of the screen under the question mark icon (?) or by emailing [sales@brightdata.com](mailto:sales@brightdata.com), [support@brightdata.com](mailto:support@brightdata.com) or [compliance@brightdata.com](mailto:compliance@brightdata.com)

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is zproxy.lum-superproxy.io? " defaultOpen="false">
    zproxy.lum-superproxy.io is a deprecated proxy integration endpoint that was used by Bright Data in the past - It should not be used anymore as it has been replaced with: `brd.superproxy.io`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When should i use scrapers and when should i use datasets?" defaultOpen="false">
    **When should I use scrapers vs. datasets?**

    * Use Scrapers: When you need fresh or real-time data (e.g., prices, news, or live updates) or if the data isn’t available in existing datasets. Scrapers are ideal for tracking changes over time or gathering niche, specific information directly from websites.
    * Use Datasets: When you need historical data or pre-collected, and structured information. Datasets save time and effort, especially for machine learning, analytics, or research, but may not always be up-to-date.

    For ongoing projects, you can combine datasets for historical context and scrapers for real-time updates.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I want to DELETE my account">
    If you wish to completely delete your account:

    * Go to Settings -> Account Settings -> Profile.
    * Click on Delete account

    Notice that:

    * This action cannot be undone.
    * All your data and settings will be lost
    * All users will be logged out and lose access to the Bright Data Control Panel
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I find my Bright Data account ID? ">
    Your Bright Data account ID is a component in your proxy username credentials, and when asking for support, you may need to provide it so a support engineer can provide a proper answer.

    Your account ID and login to Bright Data control panel **are not** your proxy logins. Each zone has its own username and password to access.

    You can see your bright data account ID if you click the User icon on the top right part of your control panel, or by browsing to : "Account settings" on the left menu and selecting the "Profile" tab. You can access the profile tab directly by using this link: [https://brightdata.com/cp/setting/customer\_details](https://brightdata.com/cp/setting/customer_details)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What do I need to do to submit KYC?">
    In order to submit a KYC you must register to [BrightData.com](http://BrightData.com) with a **company email** Free emails like `***@google`.com or `***@yahoo.com` com are not eligible to submit a KYC. Requests from free email providers are not allowed and rejected on the spot.

    During the process, you will be required to provide proof of identity, business identity and ownership/role as well as your business use cases.
