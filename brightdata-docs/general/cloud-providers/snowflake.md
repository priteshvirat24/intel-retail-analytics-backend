# Snowflake delivery configuration guide

> Configure Snowflake as a delivery destination for Bright Data datasets (250+ domains), including connection setup and supported delivery options.

<Note>
  Snowflake configuration is available for 'Datasets' delivery and not available for data collectors (Web Scraper).
</Note>

## How to get started

In order to allow efficient delivery of Datasets to your Snowflake environment, we provide a step-by-step guide to set it up. Just follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select or Create a Database">
    Firstly, decide if you will use an existing database or create a new one. If you opt for a new database, here's the command you need:

    ```sql theme={null}
    CREATE DATABASE <database>;
    ```

    <Tip>
      Remember to replace `<database>` with the name you want for your database.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select or Create a Schema">
    Decide if you will use an existing schema or create a new one. By default every database has a PUBLIC schema. If you wish to use a different schema, here's the command you need:

    ```sql theme={null}
    CREATE SCHEMA <schema>;
    ```

    <Tip>
      Replace `<schema>` with your own schema name.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select or Create a Warehouse">
    Choose an existing warehouse or create a new one. When creating a new warehouse, consider Snowflake's recommendations for configuring a warehouse specifically for data loading. Use the following command to create a warehouse:

    ```sql theme={null}
    CREATE WAREHOUSE <warehouse>;
    ```

    <Tip>
      Replace `<warehouse>` with your desired warehouse name.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select or Create an Internal Named Stage">
    Next, choose an existing internal named stage or create a new one. To create a new stage, use this command:

    ```sql theme={null}
    CREATE STAGE <stage>;
    ```

    <Tip>
      Don't forget to replace `<stage>` with your preferred stage name.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Role">
    You'll need a role that can write to your chosen stage. To create one, use:

    ```sql theme={null}
    CREATE ROLE <role_name>;
    ```

    <Tip>Change `<role_name>` to your chosen role name.</Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Grant Warehouse Rights to the Role">
    Now, grant your new role the necessary rights to operate on your chosen warehouse using:

    ```sql theme={null}
    GRANT OPERATE ON WAREHOUSE <warehouse> TO ROLE <role_name>;
    ```

    <Tip>
      Remember to replace `<warehouse>` and `<role_name>` with your specific warehouse and role name respectively.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Write Operations on the Stage for the Role">
    To enable your role to write on the stage, use the command:

    ```sql theme={null}
    GRANT WRITE ON STAGE <stage> TO ROLE <role_name>;
    ```

    <Tip>
      Again, replace `<stage>` and `<role_name>` with your chosen stage and role names.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a BrightData User">
    Next, create a new user for BrightData that will be used to upload data directly into Snowflake. The command is as follows:

    ```sql theme={null}
    create user <user_name>
    PASSWORD = '<password>'
    LOGIN_NAME = <login>
    MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD = FALSE
    DISABLED = FALSE
    COMMENT = 'user for BrightData to upload data directly into Snowflake'
    ```

    <Tip>
      Replace `<user_name>`, `<password>`, and `<login>` with your chosen username, password, and login name.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Grant Role Privileges to the New User">
    Finally, grant your new user the privileges of the role you created:

    ```sql theme={null}
    GRANT ROLE <role_name> TO USER <user_name>;
    ```

    <Tip>
      Replace `<role_name>` and `<user_name>` with your role and user names.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Allowlist IPs">
    If you have an active Network Policy applied in your Snowflake account you need to whiltelist following IPs:

    ```sql theme={null}
    ALTER NETWORK POLICY <policy_name>

    SET ALLOWED_IP_LIST=(
        <existing_allowlisted_ips>,
        '35.169.71.210',
        '34.233.211.38',
        '44.194.183.74',
        '54.243.177.151'
    );
    ```

    <Tip>
      Replace `<policy_name>` with your network policy name. \
      Replace `<existing_whiltelisted_ips>` with the list of existing allowlisted IPs.
    </Tip>

    And that's it! You have now configured your Snowflake environment to receive data from Bright Data.
