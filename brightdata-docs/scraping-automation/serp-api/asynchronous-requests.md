# SERP API async requests

> Send async Bright Data SERP API (31 languages) and Web Unlocker API requests: compare with sync mode, learn when async is faster and configure async parameters.

<Note>
  Async is supported by both **Web Unlocker API** and **SERP API** products
</Note>

## Async VS Sync requests

There are 2 ways for us to handle your Web Unlocker API and SERP API requests:

* `default` **Synchronous requests** - Send a request and get a real-time response immediately
* **Asynchronous requests** - Send a request (without waiting for an immediate response) and retrieve the results later via our designated API endpoint. Callback times are usually up to 5 minutes but may take up to 8 hours during peak periods. Responses are stored for up to 48 hours from the time the request was sent.

<Tip>
  Async is recommended for those with high-volume requests who **don't** need to serve an immediate or live response and can wait a few minutes to retrieve all their responses at once.
</Tip>

### Why should I use Async?

* 99.99% success rate
* Stability
* Flexibility - the ability to retrieve your requests at a later time of your choosing (and not have to wait for the response immediately after sending the request)

### How it works

Sending requests and receiving responses with Async mode is a two-step flow:

* **Sending the request** - This request includes the search parameters, returns a `response_ID`, and is a direct request (i.e. you will be billed for this request).
* **Collecting the response** - This request includes the `response_ID` and is free of charge (i.e. you will not be billed for this request). If you call for a `response_ID` which is still being processed you will receive a 202 status code.

<Note>
  We store responses for up to 48 hours from the time the request was sent.
</Note>

### How to get started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable &#x22;Asynchronous requests&#x22;">
    Within your specific Web Unlocker API or SERP API [zone](https://brightdata.com/cp/zones), under "Advanced settings", enable the "Asynchronous requests" toggle. <img src="https://mintcdn.com/brightdata/S8tFtc_KJjCQxqv1/images/scraping-automation/serp-api/asynchronous-requests/async_request_CP.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=S8tFtc_KJjCQxqv1&q=85&s=8f53a7f86abc9320071b47d284adff26" alt="Asynchronous requests toggle in the zone advanced settings" width="969" height="510" data-path="images/scraping-automation/serp-api/asynchronous-requests/async_request_CP.png" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="[Optional] Setting up a webhook (POST or GET)">
    This is where you will get notified on the status of your future requests

    <Note>
      A webhook can also be set **per** request (see "Initial request parameters" below)
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sending an async request">
    The request syntax is slightly different from that of synchronous requests and requires an [API key](/api-reference/authentication#how-do-i-generate-a-new-api-key%3F) for authentication. See a basic example below (for more request parameters see below):

    ```sh theme={null}
    curl -i --silent --compressed "https://api.brightdata.com/unblocker/req?customer=[ACCOUNT_ID]&zone=[zone_name]" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer [API_KEY]" \
      -d '{"country":"us","query":{"q":"pizza","num":"100","hl":"en","gl":"au"}}'
    ```

    You'll receive a response to the above that contains an `x-response-id` header with the ID of your request. This is the `RESPONSE_ID` for this request which you will use when collecting your results in the next step.

    <Note>
      You can easily save the `RESPONSE_ID` in your script by initializing it along with your request like this:

      ```js theme={null}
      RESPONSE_ID=$(
      	curl -i --silent --compressed "[https://api.brightdata.com/unblocker/req?customer=[ACCOUNT_ID]&zone=[zone_name]](https://api.brightdata.com/unblocker/req?customer=%5BACCOUNT_ID%5D&zone=%5BZONE_NAME%5D)" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer API_KEY" -d '{"country":"us","query":{"q":"pizza","num":"100","hl":"en","gl":"au"}}' | sed -En 's/^x-response-id: (.*)/\1/p' | tr -d '\r'
      )
      ```
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Webhook notification">
    If you've set up a webhook, you'll receive a notification immediately when the requests are ready with the following parameters: `status`, `response_id`, `request_url` and `hook_data` (optional - if you've used the `webhook_data` parameter in your request).

    <Tip>
      ### Allowlist our webhook IPs

      Our asynchronous webhooks delivery sends notifications from a pair of stable IP addresses, so please make sure to allowlist them:

      1. `100.27.150.189`
      2. `18.214.10.85`
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Collecting your results">
    We recommend to wait 20 seconds prior to the first poling request to get the response, 10 seconds for the second pole and 5 for the rest.

    Bright Data may apply rate limit for excessive poling requests without response.

    To get the response, use the `RESPONSE_ID` received in step 3, send the following:

    ```sh theme={null}
    curl -i --silent --compressed "https://api.brightdata.com/unblocker/get_result?customer=[ACCOUNT_ID]&zone=[zone_name]&response_id=${[RESPONSE_ID]}" \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer [API_KEY]"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## API - Request creation - `POST /{unblocker|serp}/req`

```sh Example theme={null}
curl -i --silent --compressed "https://api.brightdata.com/unblocker/req?customer=[ACCOUNT_ID]&zone=[zone_name]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [API_KEY]" \
  -d '{"url":"https://example.com?foo=bar","country":"us"}'
```
