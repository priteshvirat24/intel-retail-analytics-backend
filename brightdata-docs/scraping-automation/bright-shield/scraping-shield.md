# Bright Data's Scraping Shield

> Control outgoing proxy traffic with Scraping Shield across 4 steps: classify domains, set rules, block requests and receive alerts to secure data flow.

Scraping shield provides data about the outgoing proxy traffic of the customers so they can have better control on their traffic, additionally, it also allows to trigger predefined actions when certain conditions are met, such as: send email alerts, block requests, etc.

## Scraping shield features

### How domains are classified

The domain classification feature categorizes outgoing traffic from the customer's proxy operations into groups like Shopping, Social Media, and Travel. Customers can see how much traffic goes to each category and drill down to see specific domains. They can also set rules to block specific categories or domains from proxy usage, and alert designated users when there is an access attempt.

<Accordion title="What can I see in the Domain Classification page?">
  On the domain classification page, you can view a chart that displays all outgoing proxy traffic from your account. This chart can be broken down by classification, domain, or zone.

  Additionally, there is a table that shows all traffic broken down by classification. Customers can expand each row of this table to see the specific domains or zones used, along with the number of requests and the amount of traffic to these domains/zones.

### Adding and using rules

Rules provide the ability for the customer to set specific actions or alerts based on the classification or domains of outgoing traffic. These rules include the ability to block requests to certain classifications or domains and to set alerts when a specific class or domain has been targeted.
