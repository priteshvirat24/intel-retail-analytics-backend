# How Bright Data handles anti-bot blocking

> Learn how modern anti-bot systems detect scrapers across 4 layers, why DIY bypasses are costly, and how Bright Data's products defeat each detection layer.

Your scraper worked yesterday. Today it returns a 403, a CAPTCHA page, or worse: valid-looking HTML with completely wrong data. What changed?

Websites layer multiple detection systems that evolve constantly. This guide explains the detection layers that block scrapers, why maintaining anti-blocking yourself is costly, and how Bright Data's products defeat each layer.

## Why scrapers get blocked

Modern anti-bot systems don't rely on a single signal. They combine multiple detection layers, and failing any one of them triggers a block.

DIY scraping refers to building and maintaining your own scraping infrastructure: writing parsers, managing proxies, handling CAPTCHAs, and patching browser fingerprints yourself. Here is why each detection layer makes that difficult:

| Detection layer            | What it checks                                         | Why DIY scraping struggles                                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IP reputation**          | Historical behavior of your IP address                 | Datacenter IPs are flagged instantly; rotating residential IPs requires a large, clean pool                |
| **TLS/JA3 fingerprinting** | The TLS handshake signature of your HTTP client        | Libraries like Python `requests` send identical JA3 hashes on every request, matching known bot signatures |
| **Browser fingerprinting** | Canvas, WebGL, fonts, screen resolution, audio context | Even headless browsers with stealth plugins leave detectable traces                                        |
| **Behavioral analysis**    | Request timing, navigation patterns, mouse movement    | Fixed intervals and linear crawl paths signal automation                                                   |
| **CAPTCHAs**               | Human verification challenges                          | reCAPTCHA v3, hCaptcha, Cloudflare Turnstile each require different solving approaches                     |

Here is what a typical blocked response looks like when scraping a Cloudflare-protected site with a basic setup:

```bash cURL theme={null}
curl -s "https://www.g2.com/products/bright-data/reviews" \
  -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0" \
  -x http://datacenter-proxy:8080
```

```html Response theme={null}
<html>
  <head><title>Attention Required! | Cloudflare</title></head>
  <body>
    <h1>Sorry, you have been blocked</h1>
    <p>You are unable to access g2.com</p>
    <!-- Cloudflare Ray ID: 7a1b2c3d4e5f -->
  </body>
</html>
```

## Why maintaining anti-blocking yourself is costly

Each detection layer requires a different countermeasure, and each countermeasure requires ongoing maintenance.

IP rotation means sourcing, validating, and retiring proxies. TLS fingerprinting means patching your HTTP client to randomize handshake signatures, something most libraries don't support natively. Browser fingerprinting means keeping headless browser patches current as detection systems update weekly. CAPTCHA solving means integrating third-party solvers and handling failures.

In practice, teams that build this in-house find that anti-blocking maintenance consumes a significant share of their engineering effort, often more time than building the actual data pipeline. When a target site updates its defenses, your scraper fails silently, returning empty fields or stale data while appearing to work normally. By the time you notice, your downstream systems have been ingesting bad data for hours or days.

Every Bright Data scraping product shares the same anti-blocking engine. The difference between products is what you get back and how much control you keep.

## How Bright Data handles each detection layer

**IP reputation.** Requests are routed through residential IPs from real ISPs across 195+ countries. Anti-bot systems treat these as regular household traffic. IPs are automatically rotated per request and flagged addresses are retired from the pool.

**TLS fingerprinting.** When your HTTP client opens a connection, it sends a TLS Client Hello that anti-bot systems hash into a JA3 fingerprint. Python `requests`, for example, always produces the same hash, which is a known bot signature. Bright Data generates a unique TLS fingerprint per request, matching the diversity of real browser populations.

**Browser fingerprinting.** Sites collect Canvas renders, WebGL data, installed fonts, screen dimensions, and audio context to build a device profile. Bright Data emulates complete, consistent browser environments that pass checks from Cloudflare Turnstile, Akamai Bot Manager, and other major detection systems.

**Behavioral analysis.** Anti-bot systems track request timing, navigation sequences, and interaction patterns. Bright Data varies request timing, simulates realistic navigation patterns, and manages session state to match human browsing behavior.

**CAPTCHA solving.** CAPTCHAs are solved automatically, including reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, Cloudflare Turnstile, and others. You never see the challenge. The response arrives as if no CAPTCHA existed.

## Which product fits your situation

Each product inherits the anti-blocking capabilities described above. The difference is what you get back and how much control you need.

**I want full control over my HTTP client and just need IPs that won't get flagged.**

Use [Bright Data Proxies](/proxy-networks/introduction). Four types are available: residential (highest trust, best for protected sites), datacenter (fastest, best for unprotected sites), ISP (residential trust at datacenter speed), and mobile (highest trust, best for heavily protected targets). Proxies solve IP reputation but leave the other four detection layers to you.

**I need raw HTML from protected sites without building anti-blocking myself.**

Use [Web Unlocker](/scraping-automation/web-unlocker/introduction). Send a URL, get back clean HTML. All five detection layers are handled in a single API call: IP rotation, TLS fingerprinting, browser fingerprinting, behavioral emulation, and CAPTCHA solving.

**I need to navigate to click through pagination, or interact with JavaScript-heavy pages.**

Use [Bright Data Browser API](/scraping-automation/scraping-browser/introduction). Full cloud-hosted browsers controlled through Puppeteer or Playwright with all anti-blocking built in. Unlike Web Unlocker, Browser API runs a real GUI browser (not headless), which produces authentic rendering artifacts that detection systems are far less likely to flag.

**I need search engine results from Google, Bing, or other engines without getting blocked.**

Use [SERP API](/scraping-automation/serp-api/introduction). Search engines are among the most aggressively protected targets. SERP API handles all the anti-blocking and returns structured JSON with organic results, ads, featured snippets, and knowledge panels already parsed.

**I want structured data from popular websites without writing or maintaining parsers.**

Use [Web Scraper API](/datasets/scrapers/scrapers-library/overview). 650+ pre-built scrapers for sites like Amazon, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and Google Maps. You get clean JSON with an average of 220+ data fields per scraper. When target sites change, Bright Data updates the scrapers.

## Common misconceptions

**"Residential proxies alone solve blocking."** They handle IP reputation, but modern systems also check TLS fingerprints, browser fingerprints, and behavioral patterns. Proxies are one layer out of five.

**"Stealth plugins make headless browsers undetectable."** Cloudflare Turnstile and Akamai Bot Manager detect patched headless browsers even with Playwright Stealth applied. Browser API solves this by running a real GUI browser rather than a patched headless one.

**"Slowing down requests prevents blocks."** Rate limiting helps avoid basic IP bans, but sites like LinkedIn, Instagram, and Amazon use session-level fingerprinting that detects automation regardless of speed.

**"Proxies and Web Unlocker do the same thing."** Proxies route your requests through different IPs only. Web Unlocker also manages TLS fingerprints, solves CAPTCHAs, emulates browser behavior, handles JavaScript rendering, and retries with fresh fingerprints on failure.
