## Data Acquisition Strategies

Your strategy for data acquisition depends on your model's needs. Choose the method that best fits your use case, from foundational training to specialized, real-time data collection.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Web Archive">
    **Best for:** Foundational, large-scale model training.

    The Web Archive provides access to a petabyte-scale repository of historical web data, making it the ideal source for training large language and diffusion models that require a comprehensive understanding of the digital world.

    * **Use Case:** Pre-training LLMs, historical analysis, building base models.
    * **Next Step:** [Contact our data experts](https://brightdata.com/ai/video-data#popup-170970) for access and pricing.
    * **Learn More:** [Web Archive Documentation](/datasets/archive/overview)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Pre-collected Datasets">
    **Best for:** Fine-tuning models on specific domains.

    Our curated datasets provide structured, high-quality data across numerous industries, allowing you to efficiently specialize your model for specific tasks without the overhead of data collection.

    * **Use Case:** Fine-tuning, industry-specific models, market research.
    * **Pricing:** Starts from **\$250 per 100,000 records**.
    * **Quality:** Rigorously validated. Free samples are available for evaluation.
    * **Next Step:** [Explore Datasets](/datasets/marketplace/dataset-view)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Custom Collection">
    **Best for:** Fresh, on-demand data from specific sources.

    Initiate programmatic data collection jobs to get real-time, structured data from any public URL. This gives you complete control over the freshness and specificity of your training data.

    * **Use Case:** Real-time applications, tracking dynamic data, custom knowledge bases.
    * **Pricing:** Based on the complexity and scale of the request.
    * **Next Step:** [Contact us for a custom quote](https://brightdata.com/ai/video-data#popup-170970).
    * **Learn More:** [Custom Dataset API Documentation](/datasets/scrapers/custom-scrapers/custom-dataset-api)

    **API Example:**

    ```bash theme={null}
    curl "https://api.brightdata.com/datasets/initiate?dataset_id=YOUR_DATASET_ID&type=url_collection&view=YOUR_VIEW_ID" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '[{"url":"https://example.com"}]'
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Video & Media">
    **Best for:** Training multimodal models at scale.

    Overcome the limitations of tools like `yt-dlp` by using our resilient infrastructure. The Web Unlocker API handles rate limits, geo-restrictions, and bot detection to ensure a reliable video data pipeline.

    * **Use Case:** Training video, audio, and image models.
    * **KYC Required:** Access requires a Know Your Customer process to ensure ethical and compliant data sourcing due to the sensitive nature of media content.
    * **Next Step:** [Book a meeting with our data experts](https://brightdata.com/ai/video-data#popup-170970) to begin the approval process.
    * **API Reference:** [Media Data API](/api-reference/media-data-api/media-data-api), download video, audio, captions, thumbnails, and storyboards from YouTube, Vimeo, TikTok, and Bilibili.
