# Bright Data for AI coding agents

> Everything a coding agent needs to work with Bright Data - LLM-optimized docs, skills, MCP server, and plain-text references. Covers 100+ sources.

## For Coding Agents

This section is designed for **AI coding agents** (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, etc.) and the developers building with them.

Bright Data gives agents production-grade access to the live web: search results, web page content, structured datasets, and anti-bot bypass - all through simple APIs.

## Recommended path for agents

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install a Skill">
    Start with a ready-made skill bundle. Skills teach your agent Bright Data APIs with embedded best practices and runnable scripts.

    See [Skills →](/ai/for-agents/skills)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect the Bright Data MCP Server">
    Add Bright Data's Bright Data MCP server so your agent can search and fetch live web data directly from inside any supported tool.

    See [Bright Data MCP Server →](/ai/mcp-server/overview)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Load the LLM reference">
    Point your agent at `llms.txt` or `llms-full.txt` for a full map of Bright Data products and APIs.

    See [LLM References →](/ai/for-agents/llm-references)
