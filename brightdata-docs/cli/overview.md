brightdata search "best web scraping tools 2025"

# AI-powered discovery with relevance ranking

brightdata pipelines amazon_product "https://amazon.com/dp/B09V3KXJPB" --format json

# Control a remote browser session
brightdata browser open https://example.com
brightdata browser snapshot --compact

# Add Bright Data MCP server to your coding agent
brightdata add mcp
```

<Tip>
  The CLI alias `bdata` is available as a shorthand - e.g., `bdata scrape https://example.com`.

## How it works

The Bright Data CLI wraps the full Bright Data web data platform into simple terminal commands. Under the hood, it:

1. **Authenticates once** via OAuth, device flow, or API key - credentials are stored locally and never need to be entered again
2. **Auto-provisions zones** (`cli_unlocker`, `cli_browser`) on first login so you can start immediately
3. **Routes requests** through Bright Data's infrastructure, handling CAPTCHAs, bot detection, IP rotation, and JavaScript rendering
4. **Returns clean output** - formatted tables in the terminal, or structured JSON/CSV/markdown for automation

  **Zero configuration required.** After a one-time `brightdata login`, every command works out of the box - no tokens to manage, no zones to create, no proxies to configure.
