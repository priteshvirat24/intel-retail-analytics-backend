# Proxy errors troubleshooting

> Explore the catalog of Bright Data HTTP errors (4xx and 5xx codes), including error codes, descriptions and actions to resolve common proxy issues.

This article provides information on how to identify proxy errors from other errors, how to analyze errors, troubleshoot and resolve issues with Bright Data proxy services.

## How can I get indication on Bright Data proxy services health status?

Bright Data publishes its products and services status in this page: [https://brightdata.com/network-status](https://brightdata.com/network-status) . In this page you can see if there are current issues or incidents in the products you use or our global availability. You can also register for email alerts which are sent upon changes in our availability of reporting on wide incidents.

## What to do if I see that there is current incident in the proxy network I am using?

First, you need to check if your operations are impacted. Two main indications are degredation in response time (slowness) or increased error rates. If one of those occur, reduce your processing rate and follow the next steps to identify the issue.

## How can I tell if the error I got is originates from a Bright Data proxy?

While using our proxies, you may encounter errors that do not originate from Bright Data. To identify the source of the error, check if the response headers include BrightData error fields listed below, we cover most errors by proxy layer in those codes.

If you are still not able to get to your target website, or receive a response `HTTP` status `200` without the data you are expecting, you were probably blocked. In this article: [Overcoming website blocking](/proxy-networks/website-blocking) we provide some best practices.

## How to resolve "Proxy Error" when testing Bright Data proxies thru another software?

Many software tools and utilities use Bright Data proxies, and have a function to "Test proxy" in them. When you hit "Test proxy" and get a generic "Proxy Error" message in that software, it can originate from various reasons.

### Common issues and resolutions

* Targeting a search engine like [google.com](http://google.com) or [bing.com](http://bing.com): Bright Data lmits search engine access via its proxy networks. To resolve go to your software settings and change the test website to be: [https://geo.brdtest.com/welcome.txt](https://geo.brdtest.com/welcome.txt)
* Using Bright Data residential network without installing a certificate: Bright Data does not allow using its Residential netowork without passing a KYC verification or installing a certificate.

## Bright Data Proxy Errors Troubleshooting

## Bright Data's proxy error format and standard now supports RFC9209

Starting October 2025, Bright Data supports two sets of headers to relay proxy error in response payload:

1. Propietary `x-brd-*` fields: `x-brd-err-code` and `x-brd-err-msg`
2. Standard RFC9209`Proxy-Status` response header supporting RFC9209 standard proxy error format.

The `Proxy-Status` header standard field will eventually replace the `x-brd-*` fields, during 2026.

## What is RFC9209?

RFC9209 is the standard on how to relay proxy errors in response headers over proxy. Bright Data is adopting this standard and applied it to all its error catalog. This will allow customers' code as well as 3rd party tools using proxy as infrastructure to refer to error from proxy interaction and resolve issues faster.

You can read more about it here: [The Proxy-Status HTTP Response Header](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9209.html)

## How to implelement RFC9209?

### Example Proxy-Status HTTP header

```text theme={null}
Proxy-Status: brd.brighdata.io; 
received-status=400; 
error=destination_ip_unroutable; 
details="client-10060: Requested IP ##.##.##.## is not allocated to this zone. Select an IP that is allocated to this zone or skip the -ip parameter in proxy username."
```

### Implementation Instructions

1. Parse the response header: Ensure that your systems are configured to interpret the Proxy-Status header in HTTP responses.
2. Extract relevant fields:
   * `received-status`: Provides the HTTP status code received.
   * `error`: Describes the general error encountered.
   * `details`: Contains specific error codes and further information from our error catalog.
   * The first field in the details will be bright data error code (like: client\_10060) followed by ':' (colon) delimiter. 
   * You can browse directly to the error document using this prefix, keeping the error code exactly as shown, including the '\_' (underscore): `https://docs.brightdata.com/proxy-networks/errorCatalog#[Bright data error code]`. Example for client\_10060: [https://docs.brightdata.com/proxy-networks/errorCatalog#client\_10060](/proxy-networks/errorCatalog#client_10060)
3. Adapt your error handling processes according to these structured codes to improve debugging and ensure a seamless proxy operation.

## Bright Data HTTP proxy header fields

The following fields are returned upon and `HTTP` or `HTTPS` requests:

| Field            | Description                                                                                                                                                        | Examples                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | REST API Field Name |

The headers are relayed as part of Bright Data proxy service and customers are not billed for their bandwidth overhead.

### Deprecating x-luminati-\* headers

Starting 1-May-2026 Bright Data proxy response will not include any x-luminati-\* headers.

#### HTTP Code 200 headers deprecating

| Header                | Current header   | Description                                             |
| :-------------------- | :--------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `x-luminati-ip`       | `x-brd-ip`       | IP address of the proxy peer used to relay your request |
| `x-luminati-timeline` | `x-brd-timeline` | Internal request processing timeline for debugging      |

#### HTTP Error Code headers deprecating

| **Header**         | **Current header** | **Description**         |
| :----------------- | :----------------- | :---------------------- |
| `X-Luminati-Error` | `x-brd-error`      | Short error description |

### Getting HTTP header fields

#### Testing from command line

To view and test your settings, or restoring an issue, you can run a `curl` command from your shell prompt and add the option flag `-v` or `i`. These flags will run curl in verbose mode and print out the header fields, including the custom error code and message.

```sh theme={null}
curl -v [rest of curl command options]
```

To see a more compact view with the header fields response only use the `-i` option for curl:

```sh theme={null}
curl -i [rest of curl command options]
```

Alternatively, you can use the `nc` command to get the fields printed to screen:

```sh theme={null}
echo "[tcp nc inputs]" | nc -C -v brd.superproxy.io 44445
```

<Note>
  `nc` inputs may include "empty" lines, those are essential for correct testing using `nc` command
</Note>

#### `curl` Command snippet

`curl` command snippet, with all required zone parameters is available in the **Overview** tab in Bright Data control panel for the zone you are working on.

#### Accessing via programming language

Bright Data HTTP header fields can be accessed thru your programming language, as any other HTTP header field.

#### Accessing via Bright Data's Proxy REST API

Bright data offers a REST API to access its proxy networks as well as the Web Unlocker API and our SERP for targeting search engines. The error field names are slightly different , yet the content is identical.

Example response:

```JSON theme={null}
"status_code": 407,
"status_message": "Proxy Authentication Required",
"error": "Proxy Authentication Required",
"error_message": "No proxy credentials provided. Please add credentials and try again.",
"error_code": "client_10010"
```

## Error Catalog

### HTTP Error 400

When Using the Data center/ISP or gIPs products with the `-ip-x.x.x.x` targeting flag, the error code `400` can appear in case the IPs under your zone has been refreshed, removed, or simply changed due to system updates

<Note>
  This error typically arises after your BrightData account has been recently suspended. An automatic suspension occurs if your account balance becomes negative. If the suspension extends beyond 24 hours, the static allocated IPs will be released from your account. Upon reactivation, the reallocated IPs may differ from the original ones, thus if the previously allocated IPs are still being targeted - this error is thrown.
</Note>

Whenever this error appears, you should go to your Bright Data Zones page, and view the updated list of IPs relevant to this zone.

### HTTP Error 403

HTTP 403 response code means you are forbidden from accessing a **valid** URL. The server processed the request, but it can't fulfill the request either due to the way the request was sent by the client or due to Bright Data policy, blocking target access.

These are the `x-brd-err-code` values for HTTP error 403:

#### `kyc_required`

A request through a Residential zone created after July 7, 2026 from a company-email account that has not completed KYC returns HTTP 403. Residential access is available only to KYC-verified companies. Residential zones created on or before July 7, 2026 are not affected.

**How to fix:** Complete [KYC verification](https://brightdata.com/cp/kyc) so the Bright Data compliance team can approve Residential access. Until then, use [ISP proxies](/proxy-networks/isp/introduction) or [Datacenter proxies](/proxy-networks/data-center/introduction), which need no KYC. See the [Residential network access policy](/proxy-networks/residential/network-access).

The response body carries the stable `code` value plus the alternatives to create instead:

```json theme={null}
{
  "error": {
    "code": "kyc_required",
    "message": "Residential proxies are available to verified companies only, after KYC review, in accordance with Bright Data's compliance policy.",
    "action": "Start verification at brightdata.com/cp/kyc. Applications are reviewed by our compliance team.",
    "alternatives": [
      { "product": "ISP proxy", "plan": { "type": "static", "pool_ip_type": "static_res", "ips_type": "shared" } },
      { "product": "Web Unlocker API", "plan": { "type": "unblocker" } }
    ],
    "docs": "https://docs.brightdata.com/compliance/kyc"
  }
}
```

#### `business_account_required`

A request through a Residential zone created after July 7, 2026 from a personal-email account (not a verified company) returns HTTP 403. Residential access is available to verified companies only. Residential zones created on or before July 7, 2026 are not affected.

**How to fix:** Personal-email accounts are not eligible for Residential and are not offered KYC. Use a corporate email and contact the Bright Data team to establish business eligibility. Until then, use [ISP proxies](/proxy-networks/isp/introduction) or [Datacenter proxies](/proxy-networks/data-center/introduction), which need no KYC. See the [Residential network access policy](/proxy-networks/residential/network-access).

```json theme={null}
{
  "error": {
    "code": "business_account_required",
    "message": "Residential proxies are available to verified companies only. Eligibility requires a corporate email and full verification with the Bright Data team.",
    "action": "Contact the Bright Data team with a corporate email to determine business eligibility for Residential access.",
    "alternatives": [
