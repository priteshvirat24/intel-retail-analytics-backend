## Prerequisites

* A [Bright Data account](https://brightdata.com/cp) with an [API key](/api-reference/authentication#api-key)
* A Dify account with access to Dify Studio

## How to add the Bright Data plugin to Dify

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the plugin">
    Install the Bright Data plugin from the [Dify Marketplace](https://marketplace.dify.ai/plugins/idanvilenski/brightdata).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get your Bright Data API key">
    * Log in to your [Bright Data dashboard](https://brightdata.com/cp).
    * Go to [Account settings](https://brightdata.com/cp/setting/users).
    * [Generate an API key](/api-reference/authentication#api-key) if you do not have one.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a scraping tool to a workflow">
    1. Go to **Dify Studio** and open a **Workflow**.
    2. Add one of the Bright Data tools:
       * **Structured Data Feeds**: extract structured data from 50+ platforms
       * **Scrape As Markdown**: convert any webpage to clean markdown
       * **Search Engine**: get search results from Google, Bing or Yandex
    3. Enter your Bright Data API key when prompted.
    4. Connect an **LLM node** to process or summarize the scraped data.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run an example workflow">
    The banner image above shows this workflow. To extract Amazon product information and summarize it:

    1. **START**: input a product URL
    2. **Structured Data Feeds**: extract product details
    3. **LLM**: summarize into readable text
    4. **END**: output a clean product summary

    <Note>
      Two tips for reliable workflows:

      * Reference every stage to the output of the previous stage
      * Set a high character limit on input fields (for the URL field, choose the "short paragraph" var option)
    </Note>
  </Step>

### Scrape as markdown

Convert any webpage into clean, readable markdown for:

## Advanced: use Bright Data MCP

The Dify plugin uses hosted APIs. For advanced workflows, you can also integrate the [Bright Data MCP server](/ai/mcp-server/overview), which exposes the full Bright Data scraping and automation toolset over the Model Context Protocol.

Call MCP tools from Dify using custom HTTP requests or external service nodes to add capabilities like browser automation and real-time scraping.
