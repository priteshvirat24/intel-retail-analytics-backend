# IBM Watsonx Orchestrate

> Connect Bright Data's MCP server to IBM watsonx Orchestrate so agents can call live web scraping, search, and unblocking tools at runtime. Spans 195 countries.

          </Frame>

    * Choose a name for your Bright Data MCP server, add an optional description, and paste the MCP server URL including your API token, then click **Connect**:

      ```bash theme={null}
      https://mcp.brightdata.com/sse?token=<your_api_token>
      ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Available Capabilities">
    Once installation completes, multiple capabilities will appear in your agent's toolset. Enable the following:

    `search_engine`

    `scrape_as_markdown`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Your Connection">
    Verify the integration is working:

    * Open your agent's chat interface
    * Ask the agent to perform a simple task (e.g., "Search for recent AI trends")
    * Confirm the agent successfully retrieves and processes data from Bright Data
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example use cases

Once `search_engine` and `scrape_as_markdown` are enabled, your IBM watsonx Orchestrate agent can handle prompts like the ones below. Each example shows the user prompt, which Bright Data tool the agent will call, and the expected outcome.

### Search the live web with `search_engine`

Use `search_engine` when the agent needs fresh SERP results from Google, Bing or Yandex without being blocked.

<CodeGroup>
  ```text Market research theme={null}
  Find the top 10 results on Google for "enterprise RAG platforms 2026"
  and return the title, URL and snippet for each result as a table.
  ```

  ```text Geo-targeted SERP theme={null}
  Search Google for "best cloud GPU providers" as if I were located in
  Germany, then list the first page of organic results.
  ```

  ```text News monitoring theme={null}
  Search Bing News for "IBM watsonx Orchestrate" from the last 7 days
  and summarize the top 5 headlines with publication dates.
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Expected behavior:** the agent calls `search_engine`, parses the SERP JSON, and replies with a structured summary. No proxy setup or CAPTCHA handling is required on your side.

### Extract page content with `scrape_as_markdown`

Use `scrape_as_markdown` when the agent needs the full content of a known URL, including pages protected by bot detection.

<CodeGroup>
  ```text Competitive intelligence theme={null}
  Scrape https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate and summarize
  the key features and pricing tiers in a 5-bullet executive briefing.
  ```

  ```text Documentation lookup theme={null}
  Fetch the page at https://docs.brightdata.com/api-reference/MCP-Server
  and list every tool name with its one-line description.
  ```

  ```text Product page extraction theme={null}
  Scrape this product URL and return the title, price, rating and the
  first 3 customer reviews as JSON: https://www.example-store.com/item/123
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Expected behavior:** the agent calls `scrape_as_markdown` with the URL, receives clean markdown, and extracts the requested fields. Pages that would normally trigger CAPTCHAs or 403 responses are handled by Bright Data's Unlocker infrastructure.

### Combine both tools in one task

The agent can chain `search_engine` and `scrape_as_markdown` to answer multi-step questions.

```text Research workflow theme={null}
Search Google for "top 5 vector databases 2026", then scrape the
homepage of each result and produce a comparison table with: product
name, pricing model, supported languages and a one-sentence positioning
statement.
```

The agent first calls `search_engine` to get the URLs, then calls `scrape_as_markdown` once per URL, then synthesizes the comparison. This pattern works for competitor analysis, lead enrichment and content aggregation flows.

## What you can do next

Your agent is now connected to Bright Data and ready to:

* Extract structured data from major platforms
* Perform geo-targeted web searches
* Scrape website content while bypassing bot protection
* Process large-scale data extraction tasks
