This guide shows you how to deploy an [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/) AI agent with the official Bright Data plugin on Railway using a one-click template, so your agent gets 66 Bright Data web tools with no CLI setup and no manual plugin installation.

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/openclaw-bright-data)

The Railway template bundles the **Bright Data plugin for OpenClaw** pre-installed and pre-configured. On first boot, the container installs the plugin, registers all tools and generates a persistent gateway token, giving your agent real-time web search, bot-bypass scraping, browser automation and 50+ structured data tools across platforms like Amazon, LinkedIn and Instagram.

<Note>
  The plugin registers **66 tools** across five categories: search, scrape, batch operations, browser automation and structured web data.
</Note>

<Tip>
  Prefer to install the plugin yourself on an existing OpenClaw instance? Use the manual CLI install in [Set up Bright Data with OpenClaw](/integrations/openclaw).
</Tip>

## Prerequisites

* A [Bright Data account](https://brightdata.com) with an API key
* A [Railway account](https://railway.com) (free trial available)
* An AI provider API key: [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys) (free), OpenAI, Anthropic or Gemini

<Note>
  OpenRouter is recommended. Its free Nemotron model provides the 262K context window required to handle the 66-tool plugin manifest without rate limit errors.
</Note>

## How to deploy the template on Railway

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your Bright Data API key">
    * Log in to your [Bright Data dashboard](https://brightdata.com/cp).
    * Go to [Account Settings](https://brightdata.com/cp/setting/users).
    * [Generate an API key](/api-reference/authentication#how-do-i-authenticate-with-api-key%3F) if you haven't already done so.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy on Railway">
    Click **Deploy on Railway**. Railway creates a new project from the template.

    <Warning>
      Add a **persistent volume mounted at `/data`** in your service settings before or immediately after deploying. Without it, the gateway cannot store its configuration.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set environment variables">
    Set the following variables in the Railway **Variables** tab:

    | Variable                                                  | Description                           | Required     |
    | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------ |
    | `BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN`                                    | Your Bright Data API key              | **Required** |
    | `SETUP_PASSWORD`                                          | Password for the `/setup` status page | **Required** |
    | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`                                      | Recommended AI provider               | Recommended  |
    | `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Alternative AI providers              | Optional     |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for initialization">
    First boot takes three to five minutes. The container installs the plugin, registers all 66 tools and generates a persistent gateway token.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the setup page and copy the gateway token">
    Open `https://your-app.up.railway.app/setup`, enter your `SETUP_PASSWORD` and wait for status **DONE**. Copy the **gateway token**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect the OpenClaw UI">
    Open the OpenClaw UI from the setup page and paste the gateway token. All 66 Bright Data tools are available immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Which Bright Data tools are included?

The plugin registers 66 tools across five categories: search, scrape, batch operations, browser automation and structured web data (Amazon, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Reddit, Zillow and more).

For the full list of tools, parameters and example prompts, see the [tool reference on the OpenClaw integration page](/integrations/openclaw#available-tools).

## Troubleshooting

**Do I need to add a volume?**

Yes. Add a persistent volume mounted at `/data` before or immediately after deploying. Without it, the OpenClaw gateway cannot store its configuration and will not retain the gateway token across restarts.

**Why is OpenRouter recommended over other providers?**

The free Nemotron model on OpenRouter provides a 262K context window, which is required to handle the 66-tool plugin manifest without rate limit errors. OpenAI, Anthropic and Gemini also work if you set their API keys instead.

**The setup page is not showing my tools yet**

Wait for the `/setup` page to report status **DONE** before opening the OpenClaw UI. First boot takes three to five minutes while the container installs the plugin, registers all 66 tools and generates the gateway token.
