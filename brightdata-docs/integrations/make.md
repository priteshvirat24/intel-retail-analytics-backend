3. **Filter a Dataset** – Apply filters to datasets and generate refined snapshots.
4. **Get a Snapshot Metadata** – Fetch detailed metadata for a snapshot.
5. **Get a Snapshot Part** – Retrieve a specific section of a snapshot.
6. **Make an API Call** – Execute any authorized request to Bright Data’s API.
